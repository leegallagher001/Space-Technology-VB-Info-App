SPACE TECHNOLOGY - A Visual Basic .NET Windows Forms Info Application!

Hello, and welcome to SPACE TECHNOLOGY, a Windows Forms app I've built to write about one of my favourite topics - the various types of technology used in space.

(NOTE: in order to get the RichTextBox elements to work as they should, the .txt files in the folder "Space Technology VB Info App - Text Info Documents" should be copied into the "net8.0-windows" folder inside the main project folder.)
