SPACE TECHNOLOGY VISUAL BASIC APP

08/10/2025

Began work on the application, making the first five pages (Home, Satellites, Spacecraft, Landers, Space Stations) and adding images. Buttons for page navigation as well as home and exit buttons added and linked - preliminary testing suggests that they are working well.

Next steps:

- Begin work on RTF documents that the pages will display.

- Think about how I may go about adding a couple of additional pages (a gallery and a quiz page).

Started work on text files for the app. I initially used .rtf (Rich Text Format) files but as it turns out getting a text file to load into a Visual Basic RichTextBox is considerably more complicated than I thought - I thought it would just be a matter of loading the file into it upon page loading, but it turns out it only accepts certain formats. Every day is a school day!

Next steps:

- Continue work on text files

Didn't have much time today but it struck me that I could probably style the RichTextBox elements a little, so I gave them a dark grey background with white text in a slightly bigger size with the Consolas font. Will probably experiment with other changes when I have the time. Still need to complete the RTFs after all.
